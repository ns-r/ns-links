## Transport Operator

If you're posting order says **TPT OPR**, you are a transport operator. Unless you have OOCed from BMT, you will be temporarily posted to a unit for a **3-week UIP**, after which you will get posted to your **transport node** where you will spend the rest of your NS.

### UIP (unit induction program)
The following activities will happen in you 3-week UIP:
- Vehicle camoflouge
- Vehcile fire movement (basically fire movement, but as a driver)
- PT (thrice a week)
- IMT + ATP, if you're PES-fit
- IPPT

The UIP is **stay-in**, without nights out. You will likely have to march to the cookhouse and back.

### Unit

After the UIP, you are posted to your unit. If you're in Transport Hub East (a transport battalion), you can be posted to either Seletar camp, Selarang camp, Bedok camp, Nee Soon camp, or Tekong (BMTC). Similarly, there are 3 other transport battalions.

You will still stay-in, but you will **nights out** on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

### Driving course
The driving course works on a slot-by-slot basis. If there are slots open, you will be sent for the driving course. There is always time between when you get posted to your unit and when you get a slot for your driving course. If you're lucky, you'll get the driving course within a month of your being posted, but be prepared to wait. Note that having pending medical issues, medical appointments, temporary down PES may delay your entry to the driving course.

The driving course is now **stay-in**, with nights out on Wednesdays (needs confirmation). You will sleep at Sembawang camp.
