## Things to take
- Washing powder/liquid: in BMT, no washing machines provided.
- Febreeze: useful as there is very little time to wash.
- Battery pack (around 40,000 mAh)
- Clothes hangers (at least 4-6)
- Underwears: bring around 3 more than you think you'll need
- Toilet roles: 2 should be enough for the confinement period
- Wipeable marker: this makes it easier to clean the RAC card
- 2 in 1 shower gel
- Coins (if they let you use the vending machines)
- Wet wipes/wet tissues for area cleaning

## Things to buy at eMarts

These can be bought after confinement or whenever you need them:

- Garters: it's always good to keep an extra pair
- Black tape
- Ziploc bags
- Dry-fit admin shirt
- Insect repellent
