## Tips
- **Get a haircut before enlisting**: You likekly won't get time to shower after they give haircuts. Tekong haircuts aren't fun.
- **Try to learn some Singaporean slang** if you don't know any: Start <nuxt-link to="/general/lingo">here</nuxt-link>.

## Packing guide
- **Washing powder/liquid detergent**: in BMT, no washing machines provided.
- **Febreeze**: useful as there is very little time to wash.
- **Battery pack** (around 40,000 mAh)
- **Clothes hangers** (at least 4-6)
- **Underwears**: bring around 3 more than you think you'll need. **The darker the color, the better**.
- **Toilet roles**: 2 should be enough for the confinement period.
- **Wipeable marker**: This makes it easier to clean the RAC card.
- **2 in 1 shower gel** (the Nivea one is great)
- **Coins** (if they let you use the vending machines)
- **Wet wipes/wet tissues** (for area cleaning and boots polishing)
- **Nail cutter**
- **Dark colored spectacles**

## Things to buy at eMarts

These can be bought after confinement or whenever you need them:

- **Garters**: it's always good to keep an extra pair
- **Black tape**
- **Ziploc bags**
- **Dry-fit admin shirt**
- **Insect repellent**
