## Training tips
- **Always guard your rifle**: Think of your rifle like your mobile phone. Unless you are at home, your phone is never more than a meter away from you. Similary, your rifle should never be more than a meter away from you, and must always be in your sight.
- **If you don't understand something, tell your sergeant**: It's better to learn now than mess up later.
- **Don't be first, but don't be last either**
- **Buy extra garters**
- **Walk fast**: You don't want to get knocked down for moving too slow.
- **If you have the chance, always use the toilet**: Pee as often as you can. 

## Lectures
- **Drink water every few minutes so you don't fall off asleep**

## Admin time
- **Go for a shower either first, or last so you won't have to wait in line**: If the line's already long, it *might* just be better to wait until your entire section is done. Until then, brush your teeth, defecate, fold your smart 4, and kiwi your boots.
- **Take short showers**: No more than 5 minutes unless you want your section mates to hate you. If you're the last one in your section showering, you can take more time.
- **Properly hook you tower and underwar inside the shower cubicle**: You don't want them to fall in a puddle of soapy water.
- **Don't wear clothes other than underwear inside the cubicle**: Your section mates will hate your for this.
- **Alway defecate before showering**: The toilets may have more ventilation.
- **Always keep at least one shirt in smart 4**
- **Stay clean shaven**
- **Enter the first 2 numbers on your lock before leaving your bunk**: This way, you can open your lock the fastest and be the first one to take a shower.
- **Do some light stretching in once you're in bed**
- **Bring extra food to share**: Make friends faster!

## Area cleaning
- **Use wet wipes**
- **Line up all your boots and shoes**
- **Know that there is no way to "win"**: Even if you've cleaned every corner, your sergeants will find dust.
- **Area cleaning when it's not bookout day = admin time**

## Other tips
- **Your sergeants are real people too**: If they're shouting at you, remember that they've been trained to do so. They are most likely NSFs waiting to ORD too.
- **DO NOT SIGN ON THE LINES**
- **Bookout in the uniform you sweat in**: You'll get to wash them at home. *Do not try to bookout in a uniform that's sandy (after BIC) or too wet*.
