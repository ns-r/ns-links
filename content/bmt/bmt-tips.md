## Training tips
- **Always guard your rifle**: Think of your rifle like your mobile phone. Unless you are at home, your phone is never more than a meter away from you. Similary, your rifle should never be more than a meter away from you, and must always be in your sight.
- **If you don't understand something, tell your sergeant**: It's better to learn now than mess up later.
- **Don't be first, but don't be last either**
- **Buy extra garters**

## Admin time
- **Go for a shower either first, or last so you won't have to wait in line**: If the line's already long, it *might* just be better to wait until your entire section is done. Until then, brush your teeth, defecate, fold your smart 4, and kiwi your boots.
- **Take short showers**: No more than 5 minutes unless you want your section mates to hate you. If you're the last one in your section showering, you can take more time.
- **Alway defecate before showering**: The toilets may have more ventilation.
- **Stay clean shaven**
- **Enter the first 2 numbers on your lock before leaving your bunk**: This way, you can open your lock the fastest and be the first one to take a shower.
- **Do some light stretching in once you're in bed**
- **Bring extra food to share**: Make friends faster!
