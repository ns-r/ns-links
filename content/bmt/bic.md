The BIC (battle inoculation course) is a short non hich-key event that consolidates all previous learnings on fire movement and CQB (room clearing). It is **not** compulsory for POP.

## Duration
Around half a day. The actual BIC only lasts around 15 minutes, before and after which you wait.

## The activity
- leopard crawling in sand
- room clearing (<nuxt-link to="/bmt/cqb/">CQB</nuxt-link>)
- firing of blanks at a target

All are done with live rounds being fired 5 meters above.
