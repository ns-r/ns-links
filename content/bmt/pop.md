## Infantry song

We are the bedrock of our army\
One thing to keep our people free\
Committed to the independence of our nation\
We are the men from the infantry

There will never be a mountain too high\
Or a route too rough for us\
We are about to rule the day and the darkest night\
We will never rest till the wrong is right

From the land, air and sea\
We will strike our enemies\
They have called us the queen of the battlefield

We are brothers in arms\
We are brothers proud to be\
We are the first, the one and only infantry

We are a special band of soldiers\
Raised to guard our nation's shores\
We based our lives upon a set of 8 values\
To defend our nation's cause

And when our country says she needs us\
We are always there by her side\
We will protect the lives of every Singaporean\
For Singapore we will give our lives!
