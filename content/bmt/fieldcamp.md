## Fire control order

### Contacted

- Prone and locate enemy
- Return fire

IC: Group! Improve cover! 

IC must recite FCO:

- Group
- Straight ahead
- 30
- Enemy in front of tree
- FIRE!

### Move forward

IC: IC moving forward, safe, cover me!

All men must move forward and take cover. First the IC goes, followed by 2nd man, followed by 3rd man. Remember to put your weapon in safe mode and shout out "Safe" before moving. As you're moving, count to 4. If you are not at the next tree by 4, just drop into the prone position and crawl towards the tree.

### Enemy down

IC: IC moving, safe!

IC: IC on! (*No need to say cover me because enemy already down*)

### FAFRA

1. Freeze: look around and make sure no enemy
2. Advance: go forward
3. Freeze: take a look in front, make sure nothing
4. Regroup: reorganize, high kneel to next tree
5. Ace: ammunition, condition, equipment
