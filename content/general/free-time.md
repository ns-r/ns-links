Many non-combat vocations such as transport operator and ASA require you to only work from 8 AM to 5 PM, after which you are free to do whatever you want. Here are some things to do in that time.

## Online courses

## Movies, TV shows
This is probably the first thing you've thought of. Wherever possible, download your movies or shows offline so you don't waste too much data.
