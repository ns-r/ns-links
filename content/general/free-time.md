Many non-combat vocations such as transport operator and ASA require you to only work from 8 AM to 5 PM, after which you are free to do whatever you want. Here are some things to do in that time.

## Online courses
Here are some sites which have free online courses:
- [edX](https://www.edx.org/)
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)

If you want to learn programming, here are some great YouTube channels to follow:
- [SentDex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex), mainly for Python
- [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/user/DesignCourse), for web development (Vue, Angular, React, ... basically anything web-related)
- [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb), for everything 

## Catch up on reading

Do take a few books, especially if you're in an 8-5 stay-in vocation.

## Movies, TV shows
This is probably the first thing you've thought of. Wherever possible, download your movies or shows offline so you don't waste too much data.
