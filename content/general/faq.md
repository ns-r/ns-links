## I'm enlisting at this time and this date. Is this a mono-intake?
Unfortunately, no one really knows, as this is **confidential information**. If you want to ask any other questions relating to enlistment, search for the "**Enlistment**" thread on the [NS Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/nationalservicesg). Do **not** create a new post, just look for the pinned post with the flair "**Enlistment**".

You can find the latest enlistment megathread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Enlistment%22&restrict_sr=1&sort=new).

## I have this condition. Will I get a down PES?
Unfortunately, no one but an MO can give you a definite answer. All you can do is bring a specialist letter and any other related medical documents from an outside doctor. If you are in pain and want to down PES, tell your specialist.

## Which vocation can will I get if I am PES A/B/C/E?
Again, no one can be completely sure. If you are combat-fit (PES A/B), expect a combat vocation like infantry. But combat-fit enlistees can also become transport operators, clerks, or storemen, so no one can be 100% sure.
