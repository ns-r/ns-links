The BIC (battle inoculation course) is a short non hich-key event that consolidates your previous learnings on fire movement and CQB (room clearing). It is **not** compulsory for POP.

## Duration
Around half a day. You will only be doing the actual BIC for around 15 minutes, before and after which you'll be waiting for everyone else to complete it.

## What happens
You will leopard in sand/mud along with a buddy while live rounds are being shot 5 meters above you. You will have to complete a room clearing (CQB), then fire at dummy target after taking cover in a trench. Only blank rounds are used.
